 "Example makes a much greater impression than words."
  
   This quote says that we must practice doing the action first before we say anything.
Like we say in Filipino "Puro ka lang salita".Never say anything when you are not going
to do anything. For example, when you are giving a promise. Do not let a person expect
that promise and you do not even try to do it. The said person will be so disappointed.
It is not right to trick other people especially of that person is your friend and/or
your best friend.

   Another example is that when a student persevere in studying hard. Even though he
is being teased by his classmates, he managed to graduate with a high honor. We can see
that he never spoke out to his classmates being a smart and clever person.But he proved
that he can achieve what is right for him.
